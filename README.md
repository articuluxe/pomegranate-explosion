# pomegranate-explosion #

## Emacs 24+ theme ##

### Credits ###

Emacs theme pomegranate-explosion was written 2013 by Adam Lloyd.
I believe it was ported from the color-theme package to a native theme by Syohei Yoshida in 2013.

### Installation ###
Download the .el file and place it in a directory that exists in your `custom-theme-load-path`.  
Now execute the moral equivalent of `M-x load-theme pomegranate-explosion` and Bob's your uncle.

### Explanation ###

I could not find a version of this theme anywhere else, so I provide it here to support my small patches.

### Improvements ###

Yes please.
